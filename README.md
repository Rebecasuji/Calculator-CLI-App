# Calculator-CLI-App
CLI Calculator in Python supporting +, -, , / and parentheses. Features input validation, error handling, and continuous user interaction until exit
Project Description: CLI Calculator with Parentheses Support
This is a command-line calculator application built in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Unlike simple calculators, it can evaluate complex expressions containing parentheses for proper operator precedence.

Key Features:
Supports multi-operator expressions with correct order of operations.

Handles nested parentheses in calculations.

Includes input validation to allow only safe characters.

Prevents common errors such as division by zero and invalid input formats.

Interactive CLI interface that takes user input repeatedly until exit.

Modular design with functions for arithmetic operations and safe evaluation.

Internship Relevance:
This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills, including:

Use of Python classes and functions for modularity.

Input handling and validation.

Error handling and user-friendly feedback.

Basic security awareness by validating inputs before evaluation.

Command-line interface design for user interaction.

It serves as a practical example of writing clean, maintainable code while handling real-world edge cases, a valuable skill set for software development internship
------------------ MINI GUIDENESS ------------------
# 1. Use functions for each operation
# 2. Take user input using input()
# 3. Loop until user chooses to exit
